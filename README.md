**Jan 2025 – Apr 2025 | C, Linux, Systems Programming**  

A custom **Unix-like shell written in C**, designed to replicate and extend essential shell functionality while exploring low-level **systems programming concepts**. The shell supports **process management, pipes, signal handling, environment variables, and background jobs**, and even includes **client-server networking** for multi-client communication.  

---

## 🌟 Motivation  

Modern shells like Bash and Zsh are feature-rich, but often opaque to newcomers learning how operating systems manage processes, I/O, and memory. This project breaks down the fundamentals of a working shell while extending it with **networking capabilities**, giving hands-on experience with:  

- Process control & signals  
- Memory management in C  
- IPC & pipes  
- Networking with sockets and async I/O  

---

## 🛠️ Key Features  

- **Process Management** → Forking, execution, and job control  
- **Pipes & I/O Redirection** → Support for chaining commands (`ls | grep file`)  
- **Signal Handling** → Graceful interrupt and termination management  
- **Environment Variables** → Read/write integration with shell state  
- **Background Jobs** → `&` support for concurrent processes  
- **Client-Server Networking** → Asynchronous I/O for real-time multi-client communication
